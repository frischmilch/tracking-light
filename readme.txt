video installation for light tracking

this is the code used for tracking light with a webcam and drawing on a wall.

setup: using OpenCV in processing to get webcam video.
first you have to get it running, wich might be complicated.

I put this up here because of some request on youtube. the code was never intended to be public, I will not explain it in detail. you will find some comments in it.

I used keypressing for changing modes, like debugging or showing the webcam video. see code for details.
